	<div class="text"><h1>What We Do</h1></div>
	<div class="text"><h2>Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN) is a leading advocate for the world’s oceans and marine wildlife.</h2></div>

	<div class="text"><p>Our work is based on science, fueled by people who care, and effective at catalyzing long-lasting positive change that protects the likes of green sea turtles, whale sharks and coho salmon.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><p>By working with people and communities we preserve and restore critical habitats like the redwood-forested creekbanks of California to the biodiverse waters of Cocos Island.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><h2>Mission</h2></div>
	<div class="text"><p>To mobilize people in local communities around the world to protect marine wildlife and the oceans and inland watersheds that sustain them. Our work is buoyed by thousands of supporters, volunteers and pro bono professionals, who help us extend our network around the globe.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><h2>Vision</h2></div>
	<div class="text"><p>We foresee a time when a critical-mass of people in communities all over the world share a common understanding of the intrinsic value of biodiversity and a permanent commitment to acting as wise, willing and able stewards of life in the earth’s oceans and on its lands.</p></div>

	<div class="text"><h2>Our Core Values</h2></div>
	<div class="text"><p>We believe...</p></div>
	<div class="text">
		<ul>
			<li>The well being of marine species, including sea turtles and salmon, is linked to the well-being and future of all life on earth.</li>
			<li>Raising awareness about the vital balance between life in oceans and on land is a critical step toward changing people’s understanding, attitudes and behaviors with regard to biodiversity.</li>
			<li>People have a responsibility to advocate on behalf of sea turtles, salmon and other marine species that are gravely threatened by commercial, cultural and individual human practices around the world.</li>
			<li>People in communities near and far from marine species and their natural habitats have the knowledge, capacity and power to protect and preserve marine species through direct participation as active, informed and vocal advocates.</li>
